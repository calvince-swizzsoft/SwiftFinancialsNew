Here's how to enable and configure `FILESTREAM` in SQL Server 2022 using SQL Server Configuration Manager:

### Enabling FILESTREAM in SQL Server 2022

1. **Open SQL Server Configuration Manager:**
   - Press `Win + R`, type `SQLServerManager16.msc` (for SQL Server 2022), and press Enter. This opens SQL Server Configuration Manager.

2. **Enable FILESTREAM:**
   - In the Configuration Manager, go to **SQL Server Services** in the left pane.
   - Right-click on the SQL Server instance you want to configure (e.g., `SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER)`), and select **Properties**.
   - In the Properties window, go to the **FILESTREAM** tab.

3. **Configure FILESTREAM Access:**
   - You will see three options:
     - **Enable FILESTREAM for Transact-SQL access**: Check this to enable FILESTREAM for SQL Server queries.
     - **Enable FILESTREAM for file I/O streaming access**: Check this to enable file I/O streaming access.
     - **Allow remote clients to have streaming access to FILESTREAM data**: Check this if you need remote access to FILESTREAM data.
   - Set the access level according to your needs. Setting it to `2` gives both Transact-SQL access and file I/O streaming access.

4. **Apply the Changes:**
   - Click **Apply** and then **OK** to save the changes.
   - You may need to restart the SQL Server service for the changes to take effect.

5. **Run the RECONFIGURE Command in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):**
   - After enabling FILESTREAM in the Configuration Manager, open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
   - Connect to your SQL Server instance.
   - Run the following SQL commands to finalize the configuration:
     ```sql
     EXEC sp_configure 'filestream access level', 2;
     RECONFIGURE;
     ```

6. **Verify the Configuration:**
   - To check if `FILESTREAM` is configured correctly, run:
     ```sql
     EXEC sp_configure 'filestream access level';
     ```
   - This should return the current setting for the `FILESTREAM` access level.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Administrative Privileges:** Ensure you have administrative privileges on the machine to make these changes.
- **Service Restart:** After enabling `FILESTREAM`, it's often necessary to restart the SQL Server service to apply the changes.
- **NTFS File System:** `FILESTREAM` requires that the database files be stored on an NTFS file system.

These steps should help you enable and configure `FILESTREAM` in SQL Server 2022 successfully.
